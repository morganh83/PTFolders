This folder structure should be used as a guide to help pentesters work through an external penetration test. It is by no means an end-all solution but more of a starting point. Each folder will contain suggestions on where to start and from there, it is up to the consultant to further investigate each of the results.

During a pentest, it is important to have tools running in the background while you investigate other leads that were obtained during your test. This technique is used to save time and will help you become more efficient. It is also important to keep your results organized and to take notes or screenshots of evidence along the way.

For each folder, you will find a file called '1.commands.txt'. The commands text file will have suggestions and tool syntax for you to execute. Feel free to modify the syntax to your liking and explore other options while going through these steps as each client will have different results. Again, this is not an end-all solution and you should use your skills to investigate each result and make a decision from there.
